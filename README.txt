== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
= Translation issue with the version 2.4.0 =
Recently YITH Topbar Countdown has been selected to be included in the "translate.wordpress.org" translate programme. In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'yit' to 'yith-topbar-countdown'. Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org. During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in: yith-topbar-countdown-.po yith-topbar-countdown-.mo. For example, if your language files were named yit-en_GB.po and yit-en_GB.mo, you will just have to rename them respectively as yith-topbar-countdown-en_GB.po and yith-topbar-countdown-en_GB.mo.

= Can I customize the topbar countdown banner ? =
Yes, the page is a simple template and you can override it by putting the file template "tcountdown.php" inside the theme folder. You can also customize the style by adding your custom CSS in the specific option of the settings.

= Can I deactivate the 'button' on the right of the topbar ? =
Yes simply leave the "Link" field label empty to achieve this.

= Have I to deactivate the plugin to hide topbar countdown banner ? =
No, you can deactivate the topbar countdown even if the plugin is active.
